NPM packages follows semantic version notation three digit --> major version , minor version and patch version
so new version may affect the code if our code is written in old version.

so we can check packages which are deprecated by command  -------------> npm outdated 
this command will display table of outdated packages.
Package  Current Wanted Latest  Location
slugify   I.O.O  1.3.4   1.3.4


we can also download the specific version of any package using -------------> npm i slugify@1.0.0

âœ… Instead of ^ (minor and patch releases) this symbol we can use ~ symbol for strictly that patch version which is safe side * symbol bumps all the versions

âœ… We can update package by npm update slugify 
âœ… We can delete any package by npm uninstall slugify
âœ… Package.lock.json file contains info about dependancies of dependancies along with versions
âœ… Whenever we share our code must provide Package.lock.json and Package.json file
